# Procedural-Landmass-Generation
 Really wanted to play around with procedural generation.
 This Unity landmass generator will generate a 3D map using Perlin Noise and will color specific regions of the map with the
 color based on its height (eg low land will have grass whereas tops of mountains will have snow on it).
 
 **To View this in action you can either:**
 - Download and build this repository in Unity (I have built and tested with verion **2018.4.19f1**)
 - Head to my Github pages site and find the WebGL Version there (https://maxstewart.github.io/assets/unity/ProceduralMapGen/)
